# Home_Sales
Module_22_challenege

In this Spark SQL challenge, I'm working on analyzing home sales data. I start by loading the data into Spark, creating a temporary view for SQL-style querying, and partitioning the data for better performance. Caching the temporary table in memory can speed up frequent queries, and when needed, I uncache to release memory. Lastly, I verify the success of the uncache operation. This process ensures efficient data management and enables me to calculate critical metrics on the home sales data using Spark SQL.
